# ⚾ BASEBALL SIMULATION - BISMO SPORTS ⚾
SIMULATION IN ACTION ===>> https://youtu.be/GgombSszShU?si=vjcQiJ8fwp3SC44A

* CURRENTLY STILL ADDING MORE FEATURES AND UTILIZING DATA TO CREATE A MORE IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE

This right here is my homerun project. This is what got me into the world of programming and python.

I have always had a love for the game of baseball. I have also been really fascinated by simulations, data analyzation and those what if's in sports.

Then I asked myself what if I could bring the two together. That is what brings us to here! My very own baseball simulator.

This is still a work in progress build. It is no where near perfect, clean, precise, etc. As the days and weeks go by I slowly add to it, and refactor. 

I will say I am proud of what I have built so far. My simulation predicted the Dodgers to win the world series in a clean sweep (4-0) which was just one off of the real series outcome. :)
